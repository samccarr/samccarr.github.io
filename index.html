        This website offers a map of current electric car charging stations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 
        aligned with valuable insights on where new stations could be strategically placed. It also serves as a resource 
        for both electric vehicle (EV) owners and stakeholders interested in sustainable transportation infrastructure.

    <p class = "text">
      This project inspects how electric vehicles could serve the Tribal Nations of the Great Lakes and midwestern region by connecting Tribes through an electric vehicle charging station network. 
      This consisted of extensive research about the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the future, as well as what transportation is currently being used and for what purposes
     in the local Tribal areas. 
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p> 
      There are several opportunities associated with bringing electric vehicle charging infrastructure to Tribal nations in the Great Lakes midwestern region, however location 
     and weather also create many barriers. This project maps current Tribal areas and existing charging infrastructures to show and document dead zones where electric vehicle travel is not practical, or 
     in some cases, impossible. From this map, a form for participatory installation of charging infrastructure was created for businesses to fill out, with information on the benefits of installing charging 
     stations and other incentives to do so.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class ="about-underline"> Purpose </h4>
    <p>
      There are various reasons why this project is essential, and it will have a significant social impact on the Tribal regions and the Upper Peninsula. 
      Firstly, the project aims to enhance the accessibility of electric vehicles (EVs) by establishing a network of charging stations. 
      This initiative will promote equity by providing sustainable transportation options to Tribal communities that were previously inaccessible or limited. 
      This map will address the current infrastructure gap in the Upper Peninsula Tribal territories and promote a commitment to inclusivity and equity, fostering 
      positive social progress. The initiative will increase economic empowerment and environmental conservation, improving social equity in these underserved regions.
