          This website offers a  map of current electric vehicle (EV) charging stations 
          in the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan and local Tribal Nations. There are valuable 
          insights provided on strategic placement for new stations, which is a crucial 
          resource for sustainable transportation infrastructure planning. It also serves 
          as a resource to a diverse audience including electric vehicle (EV) owners, 
          stakeholders, UP residents and citizens residing in Tribal areas, as well as 
          tourists interested in exploring the region.

    <h4 class = "about-underline">About the Project</h4>
    <p class = "text">
      This project inspects how electric vehicles could serve the Tribal Nations of the Great Lakes and midwestern region by connecting Tribes through an electric vehicle charging station network. 
      This consisted of extensive research about the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the future, as well as what transportation is currently being used and for what purposes
     in the local Tribal areas. 
    </p>
    <p class="text"> 
      There are several opportunities associated with bringing electric vehicle charging infrastructure to Tribal nations in the Great Lakes midwestern region, however location 
     and weather also create many barriers. This project maps current Tribal areas and existing charging infrastructures to show and document dead zones where electric vehicle 
     travel is not practical, or in some cases, impossible. Along with this map, a form for participatory installation of charging infrastructure was created for businesses to 
     fill out, with information on the benefits of installing charging stations and other incentives to do so.

    <h4 class ="about-underline"> Purpose </h4>
    <p class="text">
      There are various reasons why this project is essential, and it will have a significant social impact on the Tribal regions and the Upper Peninsula. 
      Firstly, the project aims to enhance the accessibility of electric vehicles (EVs) by establishing a network of charging stations. 
      This initiative will promote equity by providing sustainable transportation options to Tribal communities that were previously inaccessible or limited. 
      This map will address the current infrastructure gap in the Upper Peninsula Tribal territories and promote a commitment to inclusivity and equity, fostering 
      positive social progress. The initiative will increase economic empowerment and environmental conservation, improving social equity in these underserved regions.

    <h4 class="about-underline"> Process of EV Charging Station Considerations </h4>
    <p class="text">
      When considering the optimal placement of electric vehicle chargers, several factors must be taken into account. Firstly, accessibility and visibility are paramount. 
      Chargers should be easily found and accessed without obstacles or confusion, preferably in public locations to 
      ensure access for all EV owners, not just those in private settings. Proximity to high traffic areas is essential 
      to allow owners to charge their vehicles while engaging in their daily activities or traveling. Safety and security 
      considerations dictate that charging stations should be well-lit with security cameras, ideally located in areas with low crime rates. 
      Offering amenities and services allows owners to engage in other activities while their car charges, enhancing the charging experience. 
      Strategically placing chargers along major transportation routes ensures accessibility during long trips. Collaboration with locals is 
      crucial in identifying suitable locations and ensuring the availability of necessary resources and support. Some of the most convenient places for EV chargers 
      include workplaces, grocery stores, parking garages/lots, hotels, public spaces such as community centers, parks, and libraries, shopping malls, airports, highway rest areas,
      popular tourist attractions, and major towns.

    <h4 class="about-underline"> Eco-Friendly Benefits & Resources </h4>
    <p class="text">
      By filling out the form provided on this platform, businesses can explore opportunities to promote their business and determine their eligibility for installing a charging station 
      in their area. Leveraging this tool not only helps businesses contribute to the expansion of EV (Electric Vehicle) infrastructure, but also enhances the growing demand for eco-friendly 
      services in the region. This platform can be used to discover charging options in unfamiliar areas when planning trips, alleviating range anxiety for EV (electric vehicle) drivers. 
      Additionally, the map aids in facilitating easier navigation of the Upper Peninsula in Michigan,  contributing to promotion of eco-friendly travel in the region.
