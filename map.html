                              Instead of gasoline for combustion-based engines as is in normal cars, electric vehicles rely on battery packs set in series to energize and therefore run the motors that move the car. 
                        There are multiple batteries that are used in electric vehicles, such as lithium-ion, Nickel-Metal Hydride, and Lead-Acid, the most common of which is lithium-ion. 
                        The main components of the batteries that are used in electric vehicles, such as the lithium-ion battery include the negatively charged anode,  
                        a positively charged cathode, a metal oxide (such as lithium-cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)), an electrolyte, a separator, and a carbon based compound (usually graphite electrode). 
                        To charge the battery, when a power source is connected, lithium ions at the cathode are pulled towards it and move to the anode where the graphite 
                        intercalation compound ( like LiC6) is oxidized, forming lithium ions and graphite.
                        
                            These positively charged lithium ions are then attracted to the anode and move through the electrolyte and separator layers to become trapped in the graphite. 
                        To discharge the battery, when the power source is removed and a load is introduced, the lithium ions (wanting to be more stable) return to the cathode where an 
                        oxidation reaction occurs between lithium and cobalt-oxide, forming lithium cobalt oxide. The electrons (being attracted to the positive charge) move through the 
                        load back to the cathode. The overall chemical reaction is reversible as shown and represented by the equation LiC6 + CoO2 â‡† C6 + LiCoO2 for lithium-ion batteries 
                        specifically however it is generally similar for other batteries as well.

                        Yes it does! Since electricity comes from the transfer of electrons, the amount of electricity and therefore power is directly dependent on the ability and 
                        speed at which the electrons can be transferred. Electrons are temperature-sensitive which, in this case, means that at lower temperatures the electrons move 
                        slower and at higher temperatures faster.
