                              Instead of gasoline for combustion-based engines as is in normal cars, electric vehicles rely on battery packs set in series to energize and therefore run the motors that move the car. 
                        There are multiple batteries that are used in electric vehicles, such as lithium-ion, Nickel-Metal Hydride, and Lead-Acid, the most common of which is lithium-ion. 
                        The main components of the batteries that are used in electric vehicles, such as the lithium-ion battery include the negatively charged anode,  
                        a positively charged cathode, a metal oxide (such as lithium-cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)), an electrolyte, a separator, and a carbon based compound (usually graphite electrode). 
                        To charge the battery, when a power source is connected, lithium ions at the cathode are pulled towards it and move to the anode where the graphite 
                        intercalation compound ( like LiC6) is oxidized, forming lithium ions and graphite.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="subHeaderContent"> 
                          These positively charged lithium ions are then attracted to the anode and move through the electrolyte and separator layers to become trapped in the graphite. 
                        To discharge the battery, when the power source is removed and a load is introduced, the lithium ions (wanting to be more stable) return to the cathode where an 
                        oxidation reaction occurs between lithium and cobalt-oxide, forming lithium cobalt oxide. The electrons (being attracted to the positive charge) move through the 
                        load back to the cathode. The overall chemical reaction is reversible as shown and represented by the equation LiC6 + CoO2 ⇆ C6 + LiCoO2 for lithium-ion batteries 
                        specifically however it is generally similar for other batteries as well.

                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        Yes it does! Since electricity comes from the transfer of electrons, the amount of electricity and therefore power is directly dependent on the ability and 
                        speed at which the electrons can be transferred. Electrons are temperature-sensitive which, in this case, means that at lower temperatures the electrons move 
                        slower and at higher temperatures faster.

                    <h2 class="faqSubHeader">Are there any consequences?</h2>

                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        As explained before, the deintercalation, or the removal of lithium (or other substitute) from the carbon based lattice (usually graphite),
                        is greatly affected by lower temperatures. The deintercalation or desolvation step, which occurs during the charging process,
                        has been found to be the rate limiting step of the electrochemical reaction or the slowest step that determines the overall rate of the reaction. 
                        The reason it is the rate limiting step is because it has the highest activation barrier meaning that, in order for the step to occur, 
                        it has to receive the most amount of energy so that it can get over that barrier. In cold weather conditions, the activation barrier becomes 
                        much higher which means that in order to charge the EV battery, it requires a lot more energy than usual to even get the reaction to start that would begin the charging. 
                        This not only makes the battery much harder to charge but also the “overcharging” that has to occur to pass the barrier, negatively impacts the performance of the batteries.
