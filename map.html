                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        Unlike gas-powered cars that use combustion based engines, electric vehicles rely on battery packs to energize and run the motors that move the car. 
                        There are multiple batteries that are used in electric vehicles such as lithium-ion, Nickel-Metal Hydride, and Lead-Acid, the most common of which is lithium-ion.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="subHeaderContent"> 
                        The main components of the batteries used in electric vehicles include a negatively charged anode,  a positively charged cathode, a metal oxide (such as lithium-cobalt 
                        oxide (LiCoO2)), an electrolyte, a separator, and a carbon based compound (usually graphite electrode). 
                     </p>  
                     <p class ="subHeaderContent">
                        To charge the battery,a power source must be connected. Then lithium ions at the cathode are pulled towards 
                        it and move to the anode where the graphite intercalation compound ( like LiC6) is oxidized, forming lithium 
                        ions and graphite. 
                     </p>
                    <p class="subHeaderContent"> 
                        These positively charged lithium ions are then attracted to the anode and move through 
                        the electrolyte and separator layers to become trapped in the graphite. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "subHeaderContent">
                        To discharge the battery, the power source is removed and a load is introduced, the lithium ions 
                        (wanting to be more stable) return to the cathode where an oxidation reaction occurs between lithium and 
                        cobalt-oxide, forming lithium cobalt oxide. The electrons (being attracted to the positive charge) move 
                        through the load back to the cathode.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faqSubHeader">Does it work in cold weather?</h2>

                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        Yes it does! Since electricity comes from the transfer of electrons, the amount of electricity 
                        and therefore power is directly dependent on the ability and speed at which the electrons can be transferred. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="subHeaderContent"> 
                        Electrons are temperature-sensitive which, in this case, means that at lower temperatures the electrons move slower which negatively affects the output of the battery and causes many complications. 
                        Because of this, battery power must be used to keep batteries warm, as well as warming the cab of the vehicle.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "subHeaderContent">
                        Gasoline powered vehicles generate heat from the burning of fuel when they run, and this waste 
                        heat can be redirected to warm the cab. Battery powered vehicles do not generate heat while running. 
                        Heating accounts for most of the battery drain in cold weather, and, on average, decreases overall travel 
                        range by 25%. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "subHeaderContent">
                        At low temperatures, the mobility of ions within batteries is also impeded due to slower general movement 
                        of ions as well as increased viscosity of the electrolyte from freezing. This sluggish ion movement manifests
                        at slower charging and discharging rates, which not only affects the immediate performance of the battery but 
                        also contributes to its gradual deterioration over time. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "subHeaderContent">
                        Additionally, the occurrence of lithium plating becomes more pronounced under these conditions, where excess 
                        lithium accumulates in the battery rather than being efficiently utilized, leading to diminished overall battery 
                        efficiency and the formation of dendrites which could puncture the separator, potentially causing a short circuit 
                        and further compromising the battery's integrity.

                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        The intercalation, or the integration of lithium (or other substitute) ions 
                        into the carbon based lattice (usually graphite), is greatly affected by lower temperatures.  
                        The intercalation and desolvation steps, which occur during the charging process, have been 
                        found to be the rate limiting step of the electrochemical reaction or the slowest step that 
                        determines the overall rate of the reaction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        The reason it is the rate limiting step is because it has the highest activation barrier meaning 
                        that, in order for the step to occur, it has to receive the most amount of energy so that it can 
                        get over that barrier. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="subHeaderContent">
                        In cold weather conditions, the activation barrier becomes much higher which 
                        means that in order to charge the EV battery, it requires a lot more energy than usual to even get 
                        the reaction to happen that would charge the battery. This not only makes the battery much harder to 
                        charge but also the “overcharging” that has to occur to pass the barrier, negatively impacts the 
                        performance of the batteries.
